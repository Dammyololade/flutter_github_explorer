##Common Domain

This directory contains the core domain logic for the Flutter Github Explorer app. It includes the following subdirectories:

- `models`: Contains the domain entities that represent the core data models of the app.
- `usecases`: Contains the use cases that define the business logic of the app.

The `common_domain` directory is designed to be platform-agnostic and can be used across different platforms, such as Flutter, web, or desktop.
